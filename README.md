### benchmarking-psychology
This repository contains code and data used for "Putting psychology to the test: rethinking model evaluation through benchmarking and prediction", published in Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/25152459211026864). <br>
This repo is organized as follows:
- `manylabs1_data` contains data from Many Labs 1 (Klein et al., 2014; data available at https://osf.io/wx7ck/);
- Minor preprocessing of the data (i.e. removal of unused columns and regex replacement in empty cells) was performed using `preprocess_data.py`;
- `manylabs1.ipynb` contains the re-analysis of Many Labs 1 data discussed in the section *Model evaluation in psychology*;
- Code for the simulation reported in Figure 3 can be found in `simulation.ipynb`
